# OIBSIP_Python_Task3
🔐 Python Password Generator
✅ Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a Python-based password generator that produces strong, secure passwords tailored to user input regarding the number of letters, digits, and symbols. This exercise helped sharpen my problem-solving skills and deepened my knowledge of handling random data and user inputs in Python.

🛠️ Tools Used:
random module – For selecting random characters and shuffling the final password.

Built-in functions – input() for user input, print() for displaying the result.

🔄 Steps Performed:
User Input – Asks the user how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in the password.

Character Selection – Randomly selects:

Letters from a predefined list (uppercase & lowercase)

Symbols like @, #, $ etc.

Numbers from 0–9

Combine & Shuffle – Combines all selected characters and shuffles them to make the password unpredictable.

Display Output – Joins the list into a string and prints the final password.

🧾 Output:
A strong, randomized password like:
A#b9F@3d1!Z

✅ Length and complexity depend on user’s input.
💡 Ideal for learning how to work with strings, lists, loops, and randomization in Python.
